xhk \- HalfKey Xorg Driver Utility
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]xhk\f[] [\f[B]\-m\f[]] [\f[B]\-d\f[]] [\f[B]\-h\f[]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]xHK\f[] is a half keyboard mirroring implementation to help one
handed typist.
.PP
Running xhk detaches the keyboard, and intercepts all input; processing
it for space bar pushes as it goes.
The space bar acts as a modifier if it is held at the same time as a
standard letter.
Modifying acts to mirror the input such that key presses are mirrored
down the middle of the home row.
Pressing space, and then releasing will still provide a single space
character.
